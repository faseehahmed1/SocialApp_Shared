# Backend Practice Project - Controller-Service-Data Layer Pattern

## Overview

This repository is a backend practice project where I explored and implemented the Controller-Service-Data Layer design pattern. The goal was to deepen my understanding of building scalable and maintainable backend applications using .NET and PostgreSQL. This project simulates the structure of a real-world application with controllers, services, and data layers clearly separated to follow best practices in software architecture.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to:

- Practice backend development by implementing a structured and layered architecture.

- Learn Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to interact with a PostgreSQL database.

- Understand data migrations by building models and applying migrations to update the database schema.

- Write unit tests using NUnit, FakeItEasy, and Fluent Assertions.

- Implement exception handling with try-catch blocks in controllers to validate data and ensure robustness.

- Test API endpoints through Postman to verify the functionality of the backend.
